My current research focuses on phonotactic learning and neural nets; I model sounds and their ability to combine with others to rate acceptability of novel words in a given language. More broadly, I am passionate about ways that deep learning can be integrated with theoretical linguistics.

I also work with the Center for Language Teaching Advancement (CeLTA) at Michigan State, helping to develop Language for Specific Purposes (LSP) courses and advising students in the Master's in Foreign Language Teaching (MAFLT) program.

As a research assistant in linguistics at MSU, I have also worked on the semantics of classifiers and numerals in Thai and phonological perception experiments.
